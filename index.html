        <p3>BookFinder doesn't sell or deliver any of the products listed on our site. Instead, we list information about books that can be purchased from booksellers<br> around the world. We work hard to make sure that the information presented on our site<br>            is complete and accurate. BookFinder.com is like a telephone directory; we provide information about thousands of people, but we're obviously not able <br>to manage or take responsibility for the people we list.</p3>
